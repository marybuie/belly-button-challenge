# belly-button-challenge

I relied a little bit on getbootstrap.com, stack overflow, and w3 schools throughout the course of this assignment, but I mostly relied on the practice code for module 14 for reference.
I asked chat gpt to help me understand a couple concepts ("explain the difference between var and let"), ("think I'm missing a bracket, proofread this code for typos or other possible errors"), 
("webpage does not update when dropdown menu selection is changed, help me troubleshoot"), ("explain each line of code to me and tell me what each function does").
I find it easier to ask chat gpt to explain concepts rather than parsing through google results to find a question similar to the one I need answered,
and it comes in handy when I need a tool that can operate similarly to spell-check for large blocks of code,
but when I need actual assistance with syntax, the practice code more than suffices.
